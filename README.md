# Leaf-ID

This is a project that started to distinguish tree species from pictures of their leaves. After a quick logisitic regression model proved fairly accurate on its own, I began using this as a platform for experimenting with machine learning techniques in support of improving accuracy, including the use of a selu activation function in an autoencoder to reduce feature dimensionality. This project is a work in progress.
Data comes from the leafsnap dataset.

## Getting Started

To use any code as intended, you must download the leafsnap dataset. Logistic regression is implemented in Octave, neural network models are implemented in TensorFlow via the python API. Julia files also included are in-progress attempts to implement neural networks in that language.
